# Blog

My blog based on [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/commit/4dc808ddf889bae61244e77f7f36019a144b47f1). At the time of making the first version of this blog, the master branch of minima had some nice features that weren't released yet, so i just grabbed the master branch and continued from it. Eventually I plan to actually use the theme normally.
